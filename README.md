### OWASP SEASIDES BLE-UAE(Understanding and Exploitation)
BLE â€“ Bluetooth low energy is current trend in communication for the IoT devices, it will help to control the device and sharing, receiving the information there are two differences in the Bluetooth
Classic bluetooth
Smart Bluetooth called as BLE

### DELIVERABLES
Training Slides
Video tutorials

### REQUIREMENTS
Laptop with minimum 100 GB Hard Disk Space & 8 GB RAM with administrative privileges
Latest Virtual-box installed
Rooted device or Emulator ex. genymotion

### Topics will be covered
IoT intro
Understanding Micro controllers in IoT platform
ESP32
Arduio Software
C++ and Arduino programming
Flash the devices
Understanding the IoT Device communication
Classic and Smart Bluetooth
Develop the code and flashing
Communicating with smart phone
Exploitation
Installation of software and hardware
Tools for exploiting BLE
Sniffing BLE packets using ubertooth/BLE sniffer
Analyzing BLE packets on the Wireshark

Latest BLE Attack

### What you will get from this session :
We will learn how to develop and flash the code with arduino to microcontroller to get BLE signals and understanding what are the insecurity and security in communication and will start working on the different attack vectors to compromise the target BLE Devices.
